whole character of his judgement41 Fourthly, the best type of report is one which indicates,
the arguments of counsel and sets out the judgment, or relevant portion of it, verbatim. A
report which only summaries the judgment should only be used in the absence of a fuller
report, but may not even then carry much weight42 Finally in the absence of all else the oral
account of a case by a barrister is admissible, though again this may be of limited value.43
Application of precedents
A precedent influences future decision. Every decision is pronounced on a specific set of
past facts and from the decision on those facts a rule has to be extracted and projected into
the future. No one can foresee, the precise situations that will arise, so that rule has to be
capable of applying to a range of broadly similar situations against a background of changing
conditions. It has therefore to be in general terms and ‘malleable’. As pointed out at the
beginning of the book, no word has one proper meaning, nor can anyone see to fix the
meaning of words for others, so that interpretation of the rule remain flexible and openended44
.
Applying a precedent to the instant case is a process of matching the fact –pattern of the
precedent and the ruling thereon with the fact-pattern of the instant case; if they match, the
rule is applied, if not, it is distinguished. This involves the first two kinds of knowledge
mentioned at the start of this chapter, namely, knowing the facts and knowing the law
applicable to those facts.
Knowing the facts
 Knowing the facts of the instant case involves an exercise of discretion. This lies initially
in believing or disbelieving the testimony of witnesses and weighing it on a balance of
probability. Judges are human, so the quirks of individual personalities may also play some
part occasionally.45 The discretionary element is most significant in knowing how to state the

probability. Judges are human, so the quirks of individual personalities may also play some
part occasionally.45 The discretionary element is most significant in knowing how to state the
facts, for, as pointed out in Chapter 146, it is not knowledge of facts, but knowledge of how to
state facts that is relevant; and this applies to the statement of facts of both the instant and the

precedent cases. As Lord Simon has said. ‘What is relevant is not only the statement of
material facts by the deciding judge, but also their re-statement by other judges in later
cases.47
First, the art of knowing how to state facts involves the distinction between statements of
primary and secondary (or/inferential) facts: between saying, eg that A did so and so at such
a time in such a place and saying that A acted negligently. ‘Negligence’ is commonly treated
as a question of fact, but since it is a matter of inference from a set of primary facts two couts
may state the inferential fact differently while agreeing on the primary facts48

--- Chunk 561 ---
as a question of fact, but since it is a matter of inference from a set of primary facts two couts
may state the inferential fact differently while agreeing on the primary facts48
Secondly, there is knowledge of how to state facts at different levels of generality, which
makes it possible for the deciding judge and a judge in a later case to make different
statements of facts. Thus, A may have driven a Rolls Royce car at 30 mph through Piccadilly
Circus at 2 pm on a certain Wednesday, run into B and Broken his right leg. The individual A
may be generalized into ‘person’; the Rolls Royce car may be generalized into ‘vehicle’;
Piccadilly Circus into ‘public highway’; 30 mph through Piccadilly Circus at 2 pm. On
Wednesday into negligence; and B’s broken right leg into physical injury to the person. A
restatement of these facts at a more general level would be: ‘a person inflicted of physical
damage’; and more generally still: ‘the negligent infliction of damage. The higher the level of
generality, the wider the scope of the proposition. It is clear at a glance that negligent
infliction of damage’ is winder than just ‘the breaking of a given person’s right leg by the
careless driving of a Roll Royce Car’. A later judge is at liberty to accept as the factstatement of A v B a proposition at any level along the scale. Thus, one who is confronted
with situation in which a careless false statement has caused damage to person or property,
and who wishes to utilise the decision in A v B in order to hold the defendant liable, would
no doubt regard that case as authority for the negligent infliction of physical damage’, since
only at this level of generality would the ruling become wide enough to cover the instant
case49. On the other hand, another judge, wishing to impose liability for pecuniary loss
would no doubt prefer the widest interpretation of A v. B, namely, the negligent infliction of
damage.50

--- Chunk 562 ---
case49. On the other hand, another judge, wishing to impose liability for pecuniary loss
would no doubt prefer the widest interpretation of A v. B, namely, the negligent infliction of
damage.50
Thirdly, it is necessary to know how to select the material facts. The fewer material facts
included in a statement, the wider is its scope. In Rylands v. Fletcher51 the facts were as
follows: (i) A had a reservoir built; (ii) A employed B to build it; (iii) A wasw not himself
negligent; (iv) B was negligent; (v) water escaped woing to B’s negligent construction of the

reservoir and damaged C’s property. Only facts (i) and (v) were treated as material by the
court. By ignoring the absence and presence of negligence in A and B respectively, and by
generalising fact (i) into ‘anything likely to do mischief, the decision creates the sweeping
rule that whoever brings a ‘mischievous substance’ on to his land is liable for damage52
caused by its escape, irrespective of negligence.
Connected with this, fourthly, is the ability of a later judge to review the material facts of the
precedent and add to or subtract from the sub-total of facts selected by the deciding judge; or
he may re-state the facts at a different level of generality. Such re-statements extend or
restrict the ambit of the precedent in Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd. English53 the
employers were held liable for the death of one of their employees owing to the default of
another employee. At that date a servant could not hold his employer vicariously liable for an
injury inflicted by a fellow-servant because of the prevailing doctrine of commonemployment, which has since been abolished. Therefore, to hold the employers liable, it was
essential to the ratio decidendi to ignore the fact that the party at fault was a servant and to

--- Chunk 564 ---
essential to the ratio decidendi to ignore the fact that the party at fault was a servant and to
say that the employers were being held liable, nor vicariously, but for the breach of a
personal non-delegable duty to ensure that reasonable care would be taken. So stated, the rule
would attach liability to the employer of even an independent contractor. In Davie v. New
Merton Board Mills Ltd54, however, Viscount Simonds and Lord Reid appeared to place an
interpretation upon Wilsons’ Case which would dismantle this rule. They stressed the
materiality of the fact that it was not a contractor but a servant who had been at fault, which
would involve a fundamental reinterpretation of the case55 The Employer’s Liability
(Defective Equipment) Act 1969, how now overruled Davie and restored the original
interpretation of Wilsons in statutory form. The point is even more vividly brought out in the
two Wagon Mound cases. A quantity of furnace oil was carelessly allowed to spill overboard
from the SS Wagon Mound into the waters of a harbour. In Wagon Mound56 the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council Proceeded on the finding of the lower court that, according
to scientific opinion at that date, the ignition of the oil in such circumstances was not
reasonably foreseeable, and accordingly held that there was no answerability in negligence
for damage by fire. In Wagon Mound (No. 2)57, however, brought by different plaintiffs but
based on the same occurrence, the lower court stated that a bare possibility of fire might have

been foreseeable, but that the chance was so remote that it should be ignored. Accordingly,
the defendants were held not liable on the basis that fire was not reasonably foreseeable. The
Judicial Committee fastened on this advertence to even a bare possibility of fire as
constituting a material difference between the first and the second case, and, reversing the
lower court, held the defendant liable in negligence for fire damage after all. It will thus be
seen how stressing one factor as material not only enabled two different courts to reach
opposite results in the same case, but also enabled the same court to reach opposite results in
two cases based on the same happening.

combinations of facts. The facts in Donoghue v. Stevenson58 may be listed as follows, (i) A
was a manufacturer of ginger beer; (ii) A was assumed to have been negligent in that a snail
was alleged to have been found in one of the bottles; (iii) acting under contract with a retailer,
B, A delivered the tainted bottle to B without knowing that it contained a snail and thereby
committed a breach of his contract with B; (iv) B, acting under contract with C, innocently
passed the bottle to C, thereby committing a breach of his contract with C; (v) C innocently
passed the bottle to D; (vi) there had been no opportunity for an intermediate examination of
the bottle at any sage since it left. A; (vii), D was allegedly poisoned by drinking the remains
of the snail; (viii) this being a Scottish case, D sued A in the Scottish courts, and the case was
referred to the House of Lords on a preliminary point. It was held that, assuming A had been
negligent in leaving a snail in the bottle, A would be liable to D. the case was remitted to the
Scottish court for a decision on fact (ii), namely, whether there had in truth been a different
combinations of the above facts. In the first place, on fact (viii) alone it might have been
argued that an appeal from Scotland is not binding on English courts, since Scots law is a
different system59. Secondly on facts (i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) it could be said that a negligent
manufacturer is liable for damage to the ultimate consumer where there is no likelihood of an
intermediate examination the manufacturer proposition. Thirdly, on facts (ii), (ii), (vi) and
(vii) it could be said that anyone who negligently misperforms a contract and physically
damages a thirdly party, whom he ought reasonably to have contemplated as likely to be
affected, is liable to such thirdly party in tort, though he would not be liable in contact.

damages a thirdly party, whom he ought reasonably to have contemplated as likely to be

proposition as being its ratio60, while previously they generally adopted the second61. It is

Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
86
clear, therefore, that until recently tribunals had the choice of adopting one or the other.62 In
this way a case may even be given an interpretation quite other than that of the deciding
judge.
Finally, as an aside, it may be remarked that Donoghue’s case strikingly illustrates the point
that what is important in law is the statement of facts rather than even their truth. The house
of lords remitted the case to the Scottish court for trial on the ruling laid down by the House,
but this did not take place because of the death of one of the parties. So the truth as to
whether or not there was a snail in the bottle was never established and is irrelevant to the
ruling.
 Wide though the possibilities are of making different statements of facts, they are limited
by the consensual domain of the usual meanings of words. The facts of Donoghue’s case
would support any of the statements given above, but not, eg the statement that the defendant
caused a public nuisance.
Knowing the law
What is ‘law’ in a precedent is its ruling or ratio decidendi, which concerns future litigants as
well as those involved in the instant dispute. Knowing the law in this context means knowing
how to extract the rationes decidendi from cases. Satatements not part of the ratio decidendi
as obiter dicta and are not authoritative. Three shades of meaning can be attached to the
expression ‘ratio decidendi’. The first, which is the translation of it, is the reason for (or of)

--- Chunk 569 ---
as obiter dicta and are not authoritative. Three shades of meaning can be attached to the
expression ‘ratio decidendi’. The first, which is the translation of it, is the reason for (or of)
deciding63. Even a finding of fact may in this sense be the ratio decidendi. Thus, a judge may
state a rule and then decide that the facts do not fall within it. Secondly it may mean the rule
of law proffered by the judge as the basis of his decision’; or thirdly, it may mean the rule of
law which others regard as being of binding authority.
 There is a temptation to suppose that a case has one fixed ruling which is there and
discoverable here and now and once and for all. This is not so, for the ratio is not only the
ruling given by the deciding judge for his decision, but any one of a series of rulings as
elucidated by subsequent interpretations64 the pronouncement of the judge who decided the
case is a necessary step towards ascertaining the ratio, but the process by no means ends
there; subsequent interpretation is at least as significant, sometimes more so. ‘it is not
sufficient’, said Jessel MR.

right principle, or one noe applicable to the case, and it is for a subsequent judge to

87
say whether or not, it is a right principle, and, if not, he may himself lay down the
true principle’
65
Cases of overruling and reversal by superior authority are obvious instances of subsequent
correction, but they are not within the scope of the immediate discussion. For, apart from
these, the judge in a later case may restrict or enlarge the ruling as stated by the deciding
judge, or he may reinterpret that ruling in such a away as to relegate it to the status of an
obiter dictum. Accordingly, ratio is best regarded as a pointer towards the direction which
subsequent decision should take within a board spectrum of variations. It is not something
identifiable once and far all, but a continuing process, and as such it has to be viewed in a
continuum of time.
(1) Difficult though the task of finding the ratio is, there would be a measure of
agreement in propounding that no rule should be treated as ratio which would not
support the ultimate order66. Where a stated rule obviously bears no relation to
the facts, it is no more than a dictum.
(2) Even when the deciding judge has given no reason for the decision, it may be
possible for a subsequent tribunal to exact one from it67. However, no judge is
required to accomplish the impossible. If it is not clear’, said Viscount Dunedin,
‘then I do not think it is part of the tribunal’s duty to spell out with great
difficulty a ratio decidendi in order to be bound by it68
.

‘then I do not think it is part of the tribunal’s duty to spell out with great

(3) It follows from what has previously been said that different rations may be
extracted from a case depending on different ways of stating the facts.
(4) More rarely, a judge may demote a proposition in a previous case from its status
of ratio to that of dictum. Thus, the ‘neighbour’ proposition in Donoghue v.

(5) Certain types of cases do not deserve to be authorities. One type, already alluded
to, is that in which there is no discoverable ratio decidendi. Others are cases
turning purely on facts70, those involving the exercise of discretion71, and those
which judges themselves to not think worthy of being precedents72. Decisions on
the interpretation of documents are sometimes used as precedents, which is
regrettable since a court may find itself construing, not the document before it,
but judicial interpretations of similar working in other, slightly different
documents73. I do not think it right’, said Lord Denning MR, ‘ to look at previous
cases in this way. The only legitimate purpose is to use them as a guide towards
the meaning of words, so as to help in the search for the testators’ intention. They
should never be used so as to defeat this intention’
74
 The difficulties so far considered by no means exhaust the problems that may arise,
some of which are incapable of solutions. A case may involve two points, A and B, and a
decision on either in favour of the defendant, be it supposed, is conclusive of the matter,
while the plaintiff has to win on both A and B in order to win. Suppose that the judge decides
in the defendant’s favour on both issues. Which is the ratio, since either is sufficient to
support the decision?75. On the other hand, if he decides in favour of the plaintiff on point A,
but in favour of the plaintiff on point A, but in favour of the defendant on point B, who
accordingly win, and if it is accepted that no ruling can be ratio unless it supports the order
made, then the decision on point A is obiter. Even as a dictum it may nevertheless carry such
authority that a subsequent tribunal may feel obliged to follow it. If so, the nomenclature
ratio decidendi or obiter dictum for the decision on point A crease to matter. In Hedley Byrne

which the defendant had succeeded in the court of appeal and propounded a different rule,
but with a qualification attached so that the defendant was still able to win. This rule and
qualification together constitute the ratio; but even if it were said to be a dictum, the
distinction is immaterial at this level of authority.

--- Chunk 576 ---
qualification together constitute the ratio; but even if it were said to be a dictum, the
distinction is immaterial at this level of authority.
A judge may embark upon a line of reasoning involving a rule which justifies a certain
conclusion. He may then proceed along another line of reasoning involving a different rule,
wider on narrower, which also justifies that conclusion77. Lord simonds once declared that if
two reasons are put forwarded by a court for its decision, both should be accepted as part of
the radio decidendi78. One may later be rejected, as in Fisher v. Tayler’s Furnishing Stores
Ltd. 9 where the Court of appeal rejected as incorrect one of the two grounds which it had
given in an earlier case, and the rejection was later confirmed by both the Court of Appeal
and the House of Lords10. Again, if the House of Lords has given two reasons for a decision,
and declares subsequently that one of them is correct and the other wrong, the authoritative
ruling is the correct one11. This shows how subsequent interpretation determines the ratio
decidendi as between two stated rulings. Another illustration of the difficulty is Donoghue v.
Stevenson12 in which there are three rulings justifying the result, the wide ‘neighbour’ rule,
the narrower ‘manufacturer’ rule and the ‘fallacy of contractual privity’s rule. It has been
pointed out that judges used to regard the first as being ratio or dictum according to the way
in which they wished to decide. On the other hand, even the considered opinion of a judge on
a point not raised or argued will probably be treated as a dictum13. The Same applies to a
proposition which is merely a proposition of law assumed by the [Board] to be correct for the
purpose of that particular case14.
These complications multiply in appellate tribunals where there is a plurality of
judgments. It may happen that all the judges agree in the result for different reasons. Suppose

--- Chunk 577 ---
These complications multiply in appellate tribunals where there is a plurality of
judgments. It may happen that all the judges agree in the result for different reasons. Suppose
that each of five judges gives a different reasons for arriving at the same result and without
disagreeing with the reasons given and a subsequent tribunal may be said to have five
competing retiones and a subsequent tribunal may adopt any of them for the purpose of
deciding the case before itself. Suppose instead that each of the five not only gives a different
reason for the same conclusion, but also rejects the reasons given by the other four15. Here
the difficulty in the way of adopting any one opinion is that it has been condemned in four
others. Such a case, it is submitted, has no discoverable ratio and is, in any event, worthless
as an authority. It has so far been assumed that the judges agrees in the result. Whether they
disagree, further difficulties arise. As long as three at least our of five, or two out of three,
concur in the result for the same reason, their view may be said to constitute the ratio16.
Where the majority differ in their reasons while the minority agree on the reason for their
dissent, it is difficult to say what the discretion17. Finally, if a case has more than one issue
and the tribunal is not that arise cannot be resolved by any test. The judge in a subsequent

case interpretation he chooses upon it18. All this does not imply that the solution would be to
have only one judgement, even if the court is agreed. Differences in presentation and working
will avoid the danger of any one judge’s utterance being treated like an Act of Parliament19.
Obiter Dicta
Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the ratio decidendi, are classed as obiter dicta
and are not authoritative. Rationes and dicta tend to shade into each other. The former have
law-quality and are binding on lower courts, dicta, too, have law-quality, but are not binding
at all. Vis-a-vis a higher court even the ratio dicdendi of a lower court decision has only
persuasive force like that of a dictum. It has been pointed out that some dicta are so
authoritative that the distinction between ratio and dictum is reduced to vanishing point.
Dicta, which have no force, are propositions stated by way of illustration or on hypothetical
facts20. Greater difficulties attend ruling of law which are subsequently relegated to the
status of dicta by interpretation. The distinction in such cases between ratio and dictum is but
a device employed by subsequent courts for the adoption or rejection of doctrine expressed in
previous cases according to the inclination of the judges. An example would be the treatment
of Lord Atkin’s neighbour’ proposition in subsequent cases.

--- Chunk 579 ---
previous cases according to the inclination of the judges. An example would be the treatment
of Lord Atkin’s neighbour’ proposition in subsequent cases.
The weight accorded to dicta varies with the type of dictum. Mere casual expressions carry
no weight at all. ‘Not every passing expression of a judge, however eminent, can be treated
as an ex cathedra statement1. On the other hand, dicta which have been acted upon over the
years may acquire increasing respect2. A dictum may also be adopted as the ratio decidendi
of a subsequent decision and will then acquire the authority of that tribunal. In Zeidman v.
Owen3 Lord Goddard CJ said ‘If we thought that the dicta, though obiter, expressed the true
construction of the Act, we should feel we ought to follow them. Finally, a suggestion has
been offered that a distinction be drawn between obiter dicta, those irrelevant to the case, and
judicial dicta, those relevant to some collateral matter but no part of the radio4. The latter will
generally be more persuasive than the former.
Subsequent history of a case
It should be abundantly clear from all this that the ratio decidendi of a case depends on the
interpretation put upon it no less than on what the deciding judge himself propounded. Later
history is thus an indispensable and continuing part of ratio. It also shows the limits of
bindingness.
Reversal
A case may be reversed on appeal. The effect of reversal is normally that the first judgment
ceases to have any effect at all. The situation is different if the case is affirmed or reversed by
an appellate court on a different point from that on which the decision in the lower court was
based. In one case, Master of the Rolls said that in such a situation the previous decision will
be of no effect at all5. This probably goes too far, and in another case it was said that the first
judgment remains binding6. The truth seems to be that in such a situation a later court has
freedom to deal as it pleases with the earlier decision.

--- Chunk 580 ---
judgment remains binding6. The truth seems to be that in such a situation a later court has
freedom to deal as it pleases with the earlier decision.
Refusal to follow 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
91
Before the doctrine of stare decisis came into being, judges freely refused to follow cases
which they considered to be contrary to principle. A judge may even now refuse to follow a
decision of co-ordinate authority, in which event the conflict awaits resolution by a superior
tribunal. Repeated refusals to follow will weaken the authority of a case; as also the refusal
by a higher court to adopt the rule enunciated by a lower court, but only if such refusal
implies disapproval of it.
The growing volume of reported cases often leads to unavoidable overlooking of relevant
authorities. Sometimes, however, a precedent may be deliberately put on one side, though
this is done rarely and perhaps as a last resort. Thus, Sellers LJ once said ‘the best way to
deal with that case is to say that it goes into the limbo of lost causes8.
Distinguishing
Repeated distinguishing of a case is evidence that the decision is not approved, and the effect
may also be to confine it more and more closely to its own special facts.
It should be evident already that the bindingness is stare decisis is not rigid since judges have
some latitude in evading unwelcome authorities9. All that the doctrine means is that a judge
must follow a precedent except where he can reasonably distinguish it; but the possibilities of
the latter are such that they reduce buidingness to the semblance of a cloud, solid looking and
clear cut when viewed from afar, but less so when one actually gets into it. A judge may, in
the first place, restate the factual part of the precedent by lowering the level of generality in
order to effect the necessary distinction. ‘A case is only an authority for what it actually
decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow

--- Chunk 581 ---
order to effect the necessary distinction. ‘A case is only an authority for what it actually
decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow
logically from it’: so said Lord Halsbury10, and this words are classic authority for this
particular distinguishing technique. The two decisions then, as Lord Simon put it, are like
‘binary starts each part of which lives within the field of the other and is essentially
influenced by it.11. In this way it is theoretically possible to confine the authority of
Donoghue v Steveson12 to the manufacture of ginger beer and to disginguish it from a case
concerning the manufacture of fruit-salaed; but it is obvious that the lengths to which this
technique can be carried have to be regulated by common sense. A distinction has to be
reasonable, else it will not satisfy the desire that justice should be done. Alternatel;y, a judge
may restate the factual part of the precedent by treating as material such additional facts as
will move it away from the case in hand13. Again, it is possible to evade a precedent by
treating the less appropriate of alternate principles as it ratio. Or, the ruling hitherto regarded
as being the ratio may be rejected as dictum. Asquith LJ once quoted the following remarks;
“the rule is quite siple: if you agree with the other bloke you say it part of the ratio; if you
don’t, you say it’s obiter dictum, with the implication that he is a congenital idiot” a And this
may well, as a matter of pure psychological fact, have more underlying truth than we know,
or care to avow14.
 On occasions it may be difficult to decide whether a case has been overruled in a
subsequent decision, or merely distinguished. Where the House of Lords, for example, has
commented adversely on earlier decisions of inferior courts, there is often a great deal of
discretion for future courts in deciding whether the House of Lords has by its comments 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
92

--- Chunk 582 ---
discretion for future courts in deciding whether the House of Lords has by its comments 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
92
destroyed the authority of those cases, or merely distinguished them and left their authority
unimpaired15.
Changed conditions
Although a case has neither been reversed nor overruled, it may cease to be ‘law’ owing
to changed conditions and changed law: cessante ratione cessat ipsa lex. It is not easy to
detect when such situations occur, for as long as the traditional theory prevails that judges
never make law, but only declare it, two situations need to be carefully distinguished. One is
where a case is rejected as being no longer law on the ground that it is now thought never lto
have represented the law16;; the other is where a case, which is acknowledged to have been
law at the time, has ceased to have that character owing to altered circumstances. It is the
latter that is under consideration. If the law-making function of courts is admitted, then it
would be easy to reject out-of-date precedents openly on the ground of changed conditions
and not have to resort to the threadbare fiction that cases only reflect what always has been
law.
Willes CJ once said, ‘When the nature of things changes, the rules of law must change
too’17. This is a truism in that the legislature and, within limits, the court should change rules
to keep the law abreast of change. The question under review is whether changed conditions
may deprive a case of its law-quality. For instance, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re
Polemis and Furness, Withy & Co. Ltd.18 was disapproved by the Privy Council in the
Wagon Mound19, but although it has never been overruled, it has been declared to be no
longer law in the light of the change in the law of remoteness of damage that had taken place.
There is also a strong suggestion in The Heron II20 that The Parana1, which had laid down a

--- Chunk 583 ---
longer law in the light of the change in the law of remoteness of damage that had taken place.
There is also a strong suggestion in The Heron II20 that The Parana1, which had laid down a
rule for assessing damages in the bygone days of sailing ships, had ceased to be law in the
conditions of modern transport. When sterling changed from being a stable to a floating
currency and after Britain’s entry into the EEC, the Court of Appeal departed from the rule
laid down by the House of Lords in an earlier case2. Later, in following their decision, Lord
Denning MR remarked ‘When the nature of sterling changes, the rule of law may change
too’3. On appeal, the House of Lords affirmed the Court of Appeal and refused to follow
their previous decision, but indicated that it was for the House, and not the Court of Appeal,
to do so. The ‘changed conditions’ rule applies only to decision which are not binding. In an
important statement of the position Lord Simon said:
‘To sum up on this part of the case: (1) the maxim in the form ‘cessante ratione cessat
ipsa’ reflects one of the considerations which your Lordships a previous decision of your
Lordships’ House; (2) in relation to courts bound by the rule of precedent the maxim
“cessante ratione cesat ipsa lex”, in its literal and widest sense, is misleading and erroneous;
(3) specifically, courts which are bound by the rule of precedent are not free to disregard an
otherwise binding precendent on the ground that the reason which led to the formulation of
the rule embodied in such precedent seems to the court to have lost cogency; (4) the maxim
in reality reflects the process of legal reasoning whereby a previous authority is judicially
distinguished or an exception is made to a principal legal rule; (5) an otherwise binding
precedent or rule may, on proper analysis, be held to have been impliedly overruled by a
subsequent decision of a higher court or impliedly abrogated by an Act of Parliament; but

--- Chunk 584 ---
precedent or rule may, on proper analysis, be held to have been impliedly overruled by a
subsequent decision of a higher court or impliedly abrogated by an Act of Parliament; but 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
93
this doctrine is not accurately reflected by citation of the maxim “cessante ratione cessat ipsa
lex”4
Overruling
This refers to the action of a superior court in upsetting the ratio laid down by a lower court
in some other case. Reversal, which is the overthrow of a decision on appeal in the same cae,
may involve disapproval of the ratio as stated by the lower court; but it need not, as where the
decision is revered on some other point. Overruling necessarily involves disapproval of the
ratio, but never affects the previous decision so that the parties in the judicata; and accounts
that have been settled also are not affected5. A theoretical question arises when a superior
court declares that a ratio enunciated previously by a lower court is wrong, but at the same
time decides the present case with similar facts in the same way but for a different reason. If
it is accepted that, whatever is held to constitute the ratio decidendi of a case, at least nothing
can be ratio which does not support the order that is made, then the new ruling is ratio; but
even if it is not, it may well prove to be so authoritative as to reduce the distinction between
ratio and dictum to vanishing point6. If a case is overruled by statute, there is some ground
for saying that its ratio is no longer authoritative7. A case may first be overruled and then
reversed, as when the ratio is overthrown by superior authority in another case while there is
still time within which to appeal in the first case, and an appeal is then lodged against the
decision, which is duly reversed8. It is also possible for a case to be first reversed and then
overruled, as when the decision is reversed on appeal on some other point without affecting

--- Chunk 585 ---
decision, which is duly reversed8. It is also possible for a case to be first reversed and then
overruled, as when the decision is reversed on appeal on some other point without affecting
the ratio, and the ratio is then overthrown in another case. If a case is overruled and the
overruling case is itself reversed9, or overruled10, the first will revive. Statutory repeal
operates prospectively, unless the statute itself subsequently overruled by statute. Does case
A revive? By analogy with the case law position it is submitted that it does11.
 It is a not possible to lay down a rule as to when it is or is not permissible to overrule12/
There will sometimes be a bold rejection even of settled doctrine13, at others three will be a
timid refusal to eradicate obsolete and Lords considered whether or not to overrule a previous
decision of its own. Various considerations were mentioned. In the first place, it was said to
be (a) Finality is necessary in developing the law; (b) a tenable view taken in case I should
not be cast aside by an equally tenable opposite view in case 2, or this in turn may be cast
aside in case 3; and (c) it is important not to encourage the re-opening of questions. Secondly,
overruling is legitimate when broad issues of legal principle are involved, or if a decision has
been disapproved, or distinguished on inadequate grounds. Thirdly, it is earlier to overrule a
recent decision before it has been acted on. Fourthly, overruling should rarely occur in
matters of statutory construction according to two of their Lordship, but two others thought
the earlier case to have been wrongly decided, only a minority were prepared to overrule it17.
 Circumstances which might tend to strengthen the authority of a case and which would
work against it being overruled are the unanimity of the court, the eminence of the judges
who composed it, the approval of the decision in later cases and by the profession at large,

--- Chunk 586 ---
work against it being overruled are the unanimity of the court, the eminence of the judges
who composed it, the approval of the decision in later cases and by the profession at large,
the evidence in the report that the issue was fully and carefully argued by counsel and that the
court took time to deliberate, and the length of time for which the decision has stood. This
last is especially important since the longer a case has stood, the more people will have 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
94
governed their transactions on the basis of what is thought to be law18. Similarly, factors
which might make a court more ready to overrule an earlier case are a lack of unanimity in
the judgments, the failure to take notice of relevant authorities, the lack of eminence of the
judges who decided notice of relevant authorities, the lack of eminence of the judges who
decided it, the fact that the report is of poor quality, the fact that the issue was not fought out
fully but was compromised, the fact that the judgment was extrempore and the matter had not
been properly argued, the fact that the case has been doubted or criticised in subsequent
decisions or by the profession or in commentaries of jurists, and, by no means least, if the
decision is thought to be plainly wrong.
 Overruling may be express or implied. It is implied when the ratio of the later decision of
a superior court is inconsistent with that of the inferior court. In view of the difficulty of
ascertaining the ratio of a case, it follows that it is equally difficult to decie whether a case
has been impliedly overruled or not19, but it does give court a loophole for escaping from
stare decisis.
 That effect of overruling is retroactive except that it does not unsettle matters which are
res judicata as between the parties to the overruled decision, and accounts which have been
settled20. Retroactivity is logically reconcilable with the theory that judges do not make law

--- Chunk 587 ---
res judicata as between the parties to the overruled decision, and accounts which have been
settled20. Retroactivity is logically reconcilable with the theory that judges do not make law
but only declare what always has been law on the hypothesis that the overruled decision was
an erroneous declaration of the law and hence void ab initio. This reason may be an ex post
facto rationalisation. A more fundamental reason seems equally plausible, namely that just
quality is inherent in every law. Therefore, an unjust (hence erroneous) precedent can never
have been ‘law’. However, the retroactive rule creates a difficulty. The House of Lords
insists that only the House can declare its own decisions wrong and that lower courts must
follow them. This implies that such previous decisions are ‘law’, albeit ‘bad law’, since no
court can be bound to follow that which is not ‘law’, albeit ‘bad law, since no court can be
bound to follow that which is not law. If so, the overruling by the House of Lords of one of
its own decisions must operate prospectively, unless there is express provision to the
contrary. Everything that occurred prior to repeal; remains governed by the repealed statute.
 Even if it is be conceded that judges do make law, the question of hardship would remain
in that those who had acted in reliance on the law prevailing at the time would be judged on
the basis of a different law made ex post facto. This consideration weighs powerfully against
overruling except for compelling reasons. A suggestion that merits serious attention is that
overruling, like repeal, should take effect for the future only, and that the decision in the
instant case should abide by the previous law for the last time1. The objections do not appear
to be conclusive. It might be said that if the new rule, which is to supplant the old, does not
support the actual decision it can only be a dictum. This might be countered by the argument

--- Chunk 588 ---
to be conclusive. It might be said that if the new rule, which is to supplant the old, does not
support the actual decision it can only be a dictum. This might be countered by the argument
that the tribunal is only freeing itself for the future from any constraining effect of its own
decision, thus enabling itself to adopt the dictum later. It might also be objected that a litigant
would not be encouraged to appeal against a bad precedent if the overruling of it would not
avail him. There is probably some substance in this in a limited number of cases, but against
it there is a factor which often stands in the way of much-needed reform. Besides, the
objection would be met by coupling prospective overruling with a discretion to overrule for
the future and for the instant case, or for the future only, or for the future, the instant case and 
Justice In Deciding Disputes: Precedent
95
retrospectively. Prospective overruling will be helpful where the object is to create a new
criminal offence, or extend an existing one, by overruling a case which had held that there is
no liability in that situation; for this would avoid having to punish the accused in the instant
case for conduct which was not a crime when he did it. 
its own decisions must operate prospectively, unless there is express provision to the
contrary. Everything that occurred prior to repeal; remains governed by the repealed statute.

Illustration

A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities.

Illustrations

	A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.

	A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.

--- Chunk 635 ---
Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.— Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

	Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.— In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

	Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,

Illustration

A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.

--- Chunk 636 ---
Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.— Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.

	Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.— Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided—

Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;

Illustration

A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.

	Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or

Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or

Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age.

	Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.

Illustration

Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.

--- Chunk 638 ---
Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided—

Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death;

	Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.

Illustration

A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death.

	Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.

--- Chunk 640 ---
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.

Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.

	Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.



Of the Right of Private Defence

	Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.



	Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend—

First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;

Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.

--- Chunk 641 ---
Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.

Illustrations

	Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.

	A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.

	Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.

	When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.

	Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.

	When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—

Illustration

A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by so firing he harms any of the children.

CHAPTER V OF ABETMENT

	Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who—

First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or

Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or

Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.

Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.

Illustration

--- Chunk 646 ---
Illustration

A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.

Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.

	Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.

Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.

Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.

Illustrations

	A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.

	A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.

Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor or any guilty intention or knowledge.



Illustrations

	A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.

--- Chunk 647 ---
A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.

	A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.

	A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.

Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence.

Illustration

A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.

--- Chunk 648 ---
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.

Illustration

A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.

1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India].

Illustration

A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.]

	Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.

Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.

Illustrations

--- Chunk 649 ---
Illustrations

	A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.



	Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3.

		The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to read as above.



	A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.

	A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.

	Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of abettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.

	Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it:

Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.

Illustrations

--- Chunk 650 ---
Illustrations

	A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y.

	A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning.

	A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.

	Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.

Illustration

--- Chunk 651 ---
Illustration

A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences.

	Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.

Illustration

A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.

	Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person who is absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.

--- Chunk 652 ---
Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life—if offence not committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;

if act causing harm be done in consequence.—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable to fine.

Illustration

A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment of death or 1[imprisonment for life]. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine, and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine.

	Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.— Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both;

--- Chunk 653 ---
if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.

Illustrations

	A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section.

	A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is punishable accordingly.

CHAPTER XVI

Of Offences affecting the Human Body

Of offences affecting life

	Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

Illustrations

	A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.

--- Chunk 744 ---
A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.

	A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.

Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.



	Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2.

	Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”.

	Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words (w.e.f. 27-9-1961).

	Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”.



Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.

Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.

	Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or—

2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or—

--- Chunk 745 ---
2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or—

3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or—

4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

Illustrations

	A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.

	A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.

	A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.

	A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.

--- Chunk 746 ---
Exception 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

The above exception is subject to the following provisos:—

First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.

Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.

Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

Illustrations

	A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.

	Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.



	A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.

	A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.

--- Chunk 747 ---
A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.

	Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.

Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.

Illustration

Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.

Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.

He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.

	A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.

	A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.

Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.

	A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.

A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.

	Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.

Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault.

Illustrations

	A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike

Z. A has committed an assault.

	A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z.



	A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the words may amount to an assault.

	Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.

Explanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under this section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the offence, or

--- Chunk 769 ---
if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or

if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact.

	Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty.—Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

CHAPTER XVII

Of Offences against Property

Of Theft

	Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.

--- Chunk 793 ---
Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.

Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.

Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.

Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.

Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.

Illustrations

	A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.



	Subs. by Act 22 of 2018, s. 7, for “section 376D” (w.e.f. 21-4-2018).

	Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).



	A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.

	A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.

	A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.

--- Chunk 794 ---
A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.

	Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.

	A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.

	A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.

	A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.

	A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.

	If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.

--- Chunk 795 ---
Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.

	A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.

	A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.

	A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.

	A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.

	A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.

	Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

Of Robbery and dacoity

	Robbery.—In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.

--- Chunk 801 ---
Of Robbery and dacoity

	Robbery.—In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.



When theft is robbery.—Theft is “robbery” if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.

When extortion is robbery.—Extortion is “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted.

Explanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.

Illustrations

	A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore committed robbery.

	A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery.

	A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z.

--- Chunk 802 ---

Illustrations

	A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.

	A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.

	A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.

	A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.

	A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.

	Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.

--- Chunk 829 ---
A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.

	A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to

Z. A has committed forgery.

	Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.

	A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.

	A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under

Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.

Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.

Illustrations

	A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.

--- Chunk 830 ---
Illustrations

	A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.

	A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.

	A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.

	A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.

	A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.

Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.
